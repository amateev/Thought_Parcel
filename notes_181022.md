    - reply button should allow users to record a video reply
        - open up a new recordRTC session and do same thing as initial message submit except instead of posting to conversations table post to conversations reply table
        - no idea how to do so UI wise currently cuz everything is pretty jumbled
    - should distinguish conversations by whether you are the conversation creator or just a participant
        - if conversation is created by you then there is an additional button allowing you to archive the conversation
        - participants can only reply or maybe even just a quick checkbox saying you read the message

Archive Thoughts
    - All conversations involving you that are archived goes here
    - also distinguish conversations by whether you are the conversation creator or just a participant
    - if conversation is closed by you (aka creator is you), you can unarchive conversation
    - if conversation creator is not you, then.... idk
