I hope to accomplish:
1) create a test environment for testing webcam (with getUserMedia) and try to have a record button and video image working
2) logout button to logout route (end session and jsonwebtoken)
3) find a way to connect users (currently thinking of having a usersAPI route, and when users click on "add new contact" or whatever it is they click on to connect with a user, it will hit that route and get back all users data; as user types in a username or email in the search field, the page will renders results from the API route that matches the typed entry so far, each entry will have a "Add Me" button next to it)
 

Need to:
- think about how SQL works with creating a chain of communication (user uploads and their contacts respond, how will these messages be related to each other in MySQL, need to think about how to structure the schema)
- think about how to store and upload videos. When users record a 30 sec vid, is this vid automatically stored to their local storage first and then uploaded to server harddrive after pressing "send"? Or is the vid being saved to the server harddrive as the video is recording?

- getting archived conversation is to be done after tackling the above problems
- incoming requests also to be done after figuring out the schema for above
